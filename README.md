## üìê Problem Definition

We solve the PDE:

\[
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = \alpha \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right)
\]
with:
- **Domain:** \( x, y \in [0,1], t \in [0,1] \)
- **Initial Condition:** \( u(x,y,0) = \sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y) \)
- **Boundary Condition:** \( u = 0 \) on all edges
- **Analytic Solution:** \( u(x,y,t) = e^{-2\pi^2\alpha t} \sin(\pi x) \sin(\pi y) \)

## üìñ Research Impact

This project showcases how **domain-specific physics can be integrated directly into neural network training** for robust, interpretable, and data-efficient solutions to PDEs.  
Potential extensions include:
- Inverse problem solving (parameter estimation from sparse observations)  
- Multi-physics PINNs for coupled systems  
- Using PINNs to accelerate traditional finite-element or finite-difference solvers  
- Applying advanced sampling strategies to improve generalization in PDE learning  

By combining **spectral bias mitigation, curriculum learning, hybrid optimization, and physical priors**, this implementation bridges the gap between theoretical PINN research and real-world scientific computing.
