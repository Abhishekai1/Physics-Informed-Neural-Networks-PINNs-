# ðŸ”¥ Advanced Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for 2D Heat Equation

This repository contains a **research-grade implementation** of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) that solves the **2D transient heat equation** with physical priors, advanced optimizer strategies, and extensive visualizations.

## ðŸ“Š Results Overview

### Model Comparisons at \( t = 0.5 \)

| Baseline PINN | Analytic Solution | PINN (Fourier Features) |
|---|---|---|
| ![Baseline](assets/baseline_pinn.png) | ![Analytic](assets/analytic.png) | ![Fourier](assets/fourier_pinn.png) |

The **Fourier-enhanced PINN** produces richer high-frequency representations, while the baseline suffers from spectral bias. The analytic solution serves as the ground truth for comparison.

Residual visualization helps identify regions where the PDE constraint is harder to satisfy, guiding further refinement strategies.

## ðŸ“– Research Impact

This project demonstrates a **bridge between theoretical PINN research and applied scientific computing**. By integrating:
- Fourier features for spectral bias reduction
- Adaptive loss reweighting
- Physical priors (energy decay)
- Advanced optimizers (Adam â†’ L-BFGS)

â€¦it provides a **robust and interpretable framework** for solving PDEs, easily extendable to:
- Inverse problems
- Multi-physics coupling
- Acceleration of traditional solvers
